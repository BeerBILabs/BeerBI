## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Next.js 16 upgrade | Breaking changes expand scope; defer to future milestone |
| Real-time theme sync across tabs | Over-engineering for single-user context |
| Custom date ranges on quarterly pages | Quarterly presets sufficient; main leaderboard has custom ranges |
| Mobile app | Web-first approach per PROJECT.md |
| Cloud LLM integration | Must be local per constraints |
