| 4 | Rankings data loading with rank changes | COMPLETE |
| 5 | All-time rankings view | COMPLETE |
| 6 | User cache integration (frontend + backend) | COMPLETE |
| 7 | Header navigation links | COMPLETE |

## Anti-Patterns

No TODO, FIXME, placeholder, or stub patterns detected across any phase.

## Tech Debt

### Phase 1: Dependency Modernization
- **Pre-existing:** `docker-compose.dev.yml` frontend-dev dockerfile path resolves incorrectly (predates this milestone, commit 578ab8f)
- **Known upstream:** @next/swc 15.5.7 mismatch warning with Next.js 15.5.11 (vercel/next.js#89251) — build succeeds despite warning

### Phase 3: Quarterly Rankings
- **N+1 API pattern:** Leaderboard makes individual API calls per user for stats; a backend batch endpoint would improve performance
- **Silent error handling:** Individual user fetch failures fall back to count=0 without retry UI
- **Cache invalidation:** User cache has 7-day TTL but no manual invalidation if user updates Slack profile

**Total tech debt:** 5 items across 2 phases. None are blocking.

## Conclusion

Milestone v1.0 is complete. All 18 requirements are satisfied, all 3 phases passed verification, cross-phase integration is fully wired with 23 connected exports and 7 complete E2E flows. No critical gaps exist. Accumulated tech debt is minor and appropriate for future backlog tracking.
