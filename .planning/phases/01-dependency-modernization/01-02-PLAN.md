<objective>
Upgrade Next.js from ^15.5.6 to 15.5.11 with eslint-config-next sync

Purpose: Apply Next.js 15.5.11 security patches and stay on the latest 15.5.x maintenance release. This satisfies DEP-01 and keeps eslint-config-next in sync with the Next.js version.

Output: Updated package.json and bun.lock with Next.js 15.5.11, verified build passing

  <name>Task 1: Upgrade Next.js and eslint-config-next to 15.5.11</name>
  <files>frontend/project/package.json, frontend/project/bun.lock</files>
  <action>
Run the following commands from the frontend/project directory:

```bash
cd frontend/project
bun add next@15.5.11 eslint-config-next@15.5.11
```

This command will:
- Update package.json dependencies
- Regenerate bun.lock with the new versions
- Resolve transitive @next/* dependencies automatically

After running, verify with:
```bash
bun list next
```
Should show: `next@15.5.11`
  </action>
  <verify>
```bash
cd frontend/project
bun list next | grep "15.5.11"
```
  </verify>
  <done>bun list shows next@15.5.11 installed</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify Next.js build succeeds</name>
  <files>frontend/project/</files>
  <action>
Build the Next.js application to verify the upgrade works correctly:

```bash
cd frontend/project
bun run build
```

EXPECTED WARNING (do not treat as failure):
```
Mismatching @next/swc version, detected: 15.5.7 while Next.js is on 15.5.11
```

This warning is a known upstream issue (vercel/next.js#89251). The @next/swc 15.5.7 is the version bundled with Next.js 15.5.11 itself -- the mismatch is inherent to the package. The build and runtime function correctly despite this warning.

The build should complete successfully and produce output in `.next/` directory.
  </action>
  <verify>
```bash
cd frontend/project
bun run build && echo "BUILD OK"
ls .next/BUILD_ID  # Build artifact exists
```
  </verify>
  <done>Next.js build completes successfully (exit 0), .next/BUILD_ID exists</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After completing both tasks:

1. `bun list next` shows `next@15.5.11`
2. `bun list eslint-config-next` shows `eslint-config-next@15.5.11`
3. `bun run build` exits 0 (warning about @next/swc is expected and acceptable)
4. `.next/BUILD_ID` file exists

DEP-01 (Next.js updated to 15.5.11) will be satisfied.

<success_criteria>
- Next.js 15.5.11 is installed
- eslint-config-next 15.5.11 is installed
- Frontend builds without errors
- @next/swc warning is documented as expected behavior
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-dependency-modernization/01-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
